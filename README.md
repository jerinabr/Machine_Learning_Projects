# Machine_Learning_Projects

This is a collection of machine learning projects I worked on using C++ or Python.

These projects are for the purpose of:
- gaining a better understanding of machine learning
- acquiring experience in implementing machine learning in real world scenarios 
- strengthening my programming abilities 

This collection is going to continue to expand as I continue to do research and find different problems to work on.
